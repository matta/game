# Roguelike Project — Vision

Author: Matt Armstrong  
Scope: 20–40 minute runs  
Status: Active Direction

# 1. Core Identity

A defensive, exploration-driven roguelike centered on durable character growth and careful survival.

The game is about building a character that hardens over time. Early floors are tense and uncertain. Mid-run, the character stabilizes. Late-run, the build expresses its identity through accumulated decisions.

The experience should feel like shaping something resilient under pressure.

# 2. North-Star Fun

Primary driver: **Build maturation through survival**

Each run is an arc of compounding investment.

The player:
- Chooses how to grow.
- Adapts to discovered threats.
- Stabilizes weaknesses.
- Gradually increases control over danger.

Growth should feel earned. Power should feel reinforced through repeated good decisions rather than sudden spikes alone.

# 3. Survival Philosophy

## 3.1 Lethal With Margin

The game is dangerous, but it allows space for recovery.

Mistakes should hurt.  
Extended poor judgment should collapse a run.  
Brief tactical slips should create tension, not immediate erasure.

A player on the edge should feel:

> “If I slow down and think, I can still survive this.”

The design provides a survivability window — not immunity, but time to react.

---

## 3.2 Durability as a Design Axis

Character strength compounds defensively as well as offensively.

Progression should provide:
- Greater control over encounters.
- Improved recovery capacity.
- More flexible responses to danger.
- Stronger positional stability.

The build becomes structurally more resilient over time.

---

# 4. Core Loop

Explore cautiously.  
Engage threats deliberately.  
Invest in growth.  
Stabilize weaknesses.  
Descend.

Exploration carries weight. Terrain, chokepoints, retreat paths, and information matter. Progress is measured not only by depth, but by increased stability and control.

Combat is an active space where positioning, pacing, and restraint influence survival.

# 5. Character Development

## 5.1 Early Identity

Within the first few floors, the character should begin to take shape.  
Stat allocations, early items, and initial perks form a direction.

The player should start to feel:

> “This is becoming a strength-based bruiser.”  
> “This is turning into a careful evasive build.”  
> “This is a defensive sustain character.”

Identity emerges gradually, not instantly.

---

## 5.2 Compounding Growth

Leveling decisions matter.

Stats and perks:
- Reinforce earlier choices.
- Open new defensive or offensive routes.
- Reduce previous vulnerabilities.

Later floors should reflect accumulated decisions rather than random variance.

---

# 6. Exploration

Exploration is deliberate.

It involves:
- Risk assessment.
- Resource pacing.
- Map control.
- Environmental leverage.

The dungeon should feel gradually subdued rather than randomly survived.

The player’s mental model of the space becomes stronger over time.

---

# 7. Items

Items exist to:
- Redirect builds.
- Reinforce defensive foundations.
- Occasionally transform a run.

Rare items may redefine trajectory, but most items strengthen or refine an existing identity.

Discovery should feel meaningful, not chaotic.

---

# 8. Emotional Arc of a Run

1. Uncertainty and caution.
2. First stabilization.
3. Defensive identity emerging.
4. A near-collapse.
5. Careful recovery.
6. Build solidifying.
7. Controlled descent into deeper danger.
8. Final confrontation shaped by long-term choices.

The run feels like forging something under sustained pressure.

---

# 9. Design Principles

1. Durable progression over volatility.
2. Defensive play is valid and supported.
3. Exploration carries strategic weight.
4. Builds compound rather than reset.
5. Recovery tools exist but are limited.
6. Investment should feel respected.
7. Tension scales gradually.

# 10. Design Terms

## 10.1 Stability

Stability means the player can continue a run under pressure without perfect play.

A stable character:
- Survives ordinary mistakes.
- Has at least one reliable way to recover control.
- Can re-enter exploration after a difficult fight.

Stability is not invulnerability. It is the ability to stay in the run long enough to make another good decision.

## 10.2 Forgiveness Window

A forgiveness window is the short safety buffer between "I made a mistake" and "the run is over."

It should:
- Absorb small tactical errors.
- Give time for at least one meaningful response.
- Stay limited so repeated poor decisions still fail.

The forgiveness window exists to protect long-run investment, not to remove danger.

## 10.3 Defensive Identity

Defensive identity is a build direction where choices increase control over danger, not only damage output.

A defensive identity may include:
- Better positioning reliability.
- Stronger recovery tools.
- Improved resistance to common failure states.
- More predictable retreat options.

A defensive identity should still require judgment. It is about durable control, not passive stalling.
