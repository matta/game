- Use @docs/plan.md for planning; keep checkmarks up to date.
- Use a TDD approach to implement new features, and fix bugs.
- Ensure the following pass with no warnings or errors:
    - cargo clippy
    - cargo test
    - cargo fmt -- --check
- Prefer "Plain English" and jargon-free explanations in documentation, comments, names in code, and commit messages. Exception: technical terms High School students would understand are fine, as are Computer Science terms a university student would understand.
- Avoid cryptic variable names; prefer words.
